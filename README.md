## Introduction
Basecode512(basecode) is a project that aims to provide a simple and efficient way to encode and decode data based on the base64 scheme. 

It is written in Python 3.9 and uses the Python Standard Library for its implementation.

And there's 2 versions:
1. **basecode**. This is the actual command-lined version of basecode512
2. **basecode-gui**. This version is for the GUI users to use.

## Installation
To install basecode512, the easiest way is to go [here](https://github.com/lucheshidi/basecode/releases) and choose a version you like(we recommend you to choose the latest version) and the page will tell you about which file you may want to download.

Or using pip:
```bash
python -m pip install basecode              # Install the latest version
python -m pip install basecode==x.xx.x      # Install a specific version
```

## Usage
To use basecode512, you can either use the command-line interface or the GUI version.

### Command-Line Interface
To use the command-line interface, you can simply run the following command:
```bash
basecode
```
You can also use the following command to get more help:
```bash
basecode --help
```

### GUI Version
To use the GUI version, you can simply run the following command:
```bash
basecode-gui
```
And I think you'll find it easier to use.

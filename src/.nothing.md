If you are reading this, you are probably looking for [readme](../README.md) boy.
Okay, here's something I want to say:
1. This is my first ***project*** and I want to make it big.

If you want to ask: Hey, how about the TCL?

I can only answer: because I have no energy to update it now.

because I saw that a lot of third-party launchers are everything better than my little console launcher.

So I have another idea:

I chatted with an AI and the AI told me that it recommends me to learn C++ and Qt5 developing so I can make a better launcher that can fight with the others launchers.

And I'm learning C++ with TheCherno and Qt5 with a Chinese video series.

So, wait for me, I will systematically learn C++ and Qt5, and then I will make a better launcher.
It's really a long way, but I will do it.

And! this is really the end, go [here](/README.md)
